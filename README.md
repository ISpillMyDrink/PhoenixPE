# Frequently Asked Questions

Can I use Winbuilder to build PhoenixPE?

No. Winbuilder is no longer developed an contains numerous bugs that have not been fixed, some of which are critical. Winbuilder bugs aside PhoenixPE also makes use of PEBakery exclusive features and additional commands that are not present in Winbuilder.

Is PhoenixPE a clone of Win10PE_SE/Win10XPE/ETC...

No. PhoenixPE development started around 2014 and was originally envisioned as a replacement for the Win10PE_SE project, which had become bloated and hard to maintain. PhoenixPE was written from the ground up in 2016 for use with the PEBakery engine.

Is PhoenixPE a replacement for Win10XPE?

No. In my option the 2 projects have different goals. Win10XPE states that _it's main objective is to be simple, user-friendly and to be as fast as possible_. This caters well to user that just want to press a button and get a working PE without much fuss.
PhoenixPE on the other hand targets advanced users and developers that what more control over how and what goes into their PE.

 Win10XPE does great at providing a simple, pre-packaged experience, however it's core codebase is cumbersome and inconsistent and in an effort to provide a simple user experience, it loses the flexibility and ease of customization advanced users crave. 
 PhoenixPE strives to be simple for both users to build, and developers to contribute to, however there is a trade off, with customization come additional complexaty.
